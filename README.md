# Agile Approaches to programming.

This was a group project to get to know our group members. It was made with using a CLI.


## How to run the program


- Open directory.
- Run the command “gradle build”.
- Run the command “gradle --console plain run”. This will run the program without the excessive output from gradle.
- The person will be prompted to inform the program as to whether they are a “user” or “admin”.
- Upon informing the program, the user or admin will be granted abilities based on what they chose, use 'help' to get a guide of what functions are avaliable.


## How to test the program


- We used JUnit for testing.
- Run the command “gradle test” to run tests and generate Jacoco Test Report.
